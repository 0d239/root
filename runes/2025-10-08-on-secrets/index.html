    <h1>on secrets</h1>
    <p class="muted">2025-10-08</p>
    <p>i don't really like secrets much.
    heavily case dependent you could argue. but in general i think the truth likely thrives with room to swim. </p>
    <p>nonetheless, lately it's funny because i feel like i have a pretty big secret. </p>
    <h2> i know in my bones that these songs are something. </h2> 
    <p>i've been around blood long enough to be familiar. i know my way around a crate or two. i'm the first critique and the last praise. and even i know the truth. </p>
    <p> i know i'm not crazy like i know the sun goes down every evening and my huelo loves my huela every morning. <p>
    i don't need to change the world or anything. <br>
    it is only freedom i have ever sought. <br>
    sometimes the evidence wants to convince me that this freedom is en route. <br>
    that all this blood might help me breathe.
    </p>
    <p> it is 12:23 am right now and i'm listening to my secret symphony. one day it will be the worlds. 24 songs done. 4 other near completion. trimming down to 23. inshallah maktub.</p>
