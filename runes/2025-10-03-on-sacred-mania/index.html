    <h1> on sacred mania </h1>
    <p class="muted">2025-10-03</p>
    <p> with strong lines of logic to support both sides, i still find myself evaded by a confident stance on whether or not the act of creation is a natural art. </p>
    <p> on one hand, it is the most normal form of movement i have ever known. but on another, at times it makes me lose my mind. </p>
    <h2> some progressively, possibly knowns: </h2>
        <li> to create is to summon something that is not with you </li>
        <li> ^proficiency in such a task likely has an inverse relationship with presence and validation in some provable but ranged fashion </li>
        <li> the only way to reach the moon is to leave the earth </li>
        <li> the only way back to earth is to leave the moon </li>
    <h2> some likely unknowns: </h2>
        <li> nobody can be certain if a "normal" exists, and it is not too efficient to consider</li>
        <li> are the nfl's parity systems strong enough? or do they measure context on a window larger than common intuition would label practictal?
          i am not too sure. but hopefully the raiders improve  </li>
        <li> how long can my spirit undergo alchemy before something irregular happens? </li>
    <p> may my walk be annointed. </p> 
    <p> i wish the best for you all. </p>
