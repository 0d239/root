    <h1> on sacred mania </h1>
    <p class="muted">2025-10-03</p>
    <h2> i still find myself evaded by a confident stance on the following:  </h2>
      <li> what is normal? </li>
      <li> what is natural? </li>
      <li> whether either of the aforementioned things exists</li> 
      <li> whether either of the aforementioned things matters</li> 
      <li> whether or not there is any difference betweem them.</li>
    <h2> a few knowns: </h2>
        <li> to create is to summon something that is not with you </li>
        <li> ^proficiency in such a task likely has an inverse relationship with presence and validation in some provable but ranged fashion </li>
        <li> the only way to reach the moon is to leave the earth </li>
        <li> the only way back to earth is to leave the moon </li>
    <h2> some more unknowns: </h2>
        <li> are the nfl's parity systems enough? would their context window size benefit from calibration? #raiders </li>
        <li> for how long can my spirit undergo alchemy? </li>
        <li> how many times has will the phoenix be born? </li>
    <h2> some comforts: </h2>
        <li> definition demands the loneliness of the frontier. the last element cannot have two neighbors. </li>
        <li> documentation of those before you can be a great ailment to treat an absence of reflection </li>
        <li> it is not normal to be able to do anything in this world. so the fact that i know i can do this means i am not normal. and i need to be okay with not being normal so that it doesn't scare me later when i get more feedback that reasserts this signal. </li>
        <li> the harmonies of madness and greatness have long helped provide a stable reference point for the concept of symphony. </li>
        <li> as long as i get up and walk every single day, i have to end up somewhere. </li>
