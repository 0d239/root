    <h1> on sacred mania </h1>
    <p class="muted">2025-10-03</p>
    <p> with strong lines of logic to support both sides, a confident stance on whether or the act of creation is natural evades me yet. </p>
    <p> on one hand, it is the most normal form of expression i have ever known. but on another, at times it makes me lose my mind. </p>
    <p> sometimes it's a mexican standoff between myself and the filament, which is only exarcebated when considering the fact that i happen to be mexican as well </p>
    <h2> what i have realized </h2>
        <li> to create is to summon something that is not with you </li>
        <li> ^proficiency in such a task likely has an inverse relationship with presence and validation in some provable but ranged fashion </li>
        <li> the only way to reach the moon is to leave the earth </li>
        <li> it is okay to leave this world to build mine </li>
    <p> may my walk be annointed </p> 
    <p> i wish the best for you all. pursure yourselves. </p>
    <p> godspeed. </p>
