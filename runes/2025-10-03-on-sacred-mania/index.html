    <h1> on sacred mania </h1>
    <p class="muted">2025-10-03</p>
    <p> with strong lines of logic to support both sides, i still find myself evaded by a confident stance on whether or not the act of creation is a natural art. </p>
    <p> on one hand, it is the most normal form of movement i have ever known. but on another, at times it makes me lose my mind. </p>
    <p> sometimes it's a mexican standoff between myself and the filament, which is only exarcebated when considering the fact that i happen to be mexican as well </p>
    <h2> some progressively, possibly knowns: </h2>
        <li> to create is to summon something that is not with you </li>
        <li> ^proficiency in such a task likely has an inverse relationship with presence and validation in some provable but ranged fashion </li>
        <li> the only way to reach the moon is to leave the earth </li>
        <li> the only way back to earth is to leave the moon </li>
        <li> it is okay to leave this world to build yours </li>
    <h2> some likely unknowns: </h2>
        <li> is anybody really normal? </li>
        <li> are the nfl's parity systems not strong enough? or are they measuring context on a window much larger than common intuition would label practical? idk man
          i'm just saying it would be nice if the correction happened and the raiders started improving at some point </li>
        <li> how long can my spirit undergo alchemy before something irregular happens? </li>
    <p> may my walk be annointed </p> 
    <p> i wish the best for you all. pursure yourselves. </p>
    <p> godspeed. </p>
