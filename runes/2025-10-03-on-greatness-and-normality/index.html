    <h1> on greatness and normality </h1>
    <p class="muted">2025-10-03</p>
    <p> after a few thousand suns of leaving footprints on the business, the current state of things is akin to many of us: i am conquerer of some things and ever evaded by others. </p>
    <h2>  the collection of items i have succeeded and failed and succeeded and failed in includes but is not limited to: love, fear, and a confident stance on the following:  </h2>
      <li> what is normal? </li>
      <li> what is natural? </li>
      <li> can a definition for either of these things be reasonably proven? </li> 
      <li> can a reason why either of these things matters be reasonably proven? </li> 
      <li> does the answer to any of these questions matter? </li>
      <li> how dangerous is inquisition when combined with recursive internal monologues? </li>
    <h2> a few knowns: </h2>
        <li> to create is to summon something that is not with you. </li>
        <li> ^proficiency in such a task likely has an inverse relationship with presence and validation in some provable but ranged fashion. </li>
        <li> the only way to reach the moon is to leave the earth. </li>
        <li> the only way back to earth is to leave the moon. </li>
    <h2> some more unknowns: </h2>
        <li> are the nfl's parity systems enough? would their context window size benefit from calibration? #raiders </li>
        <li> for how long can my spirit undergo alchemy? </li>
        <li> how many times must the phoenix be born? </li>
    <h2> some comforts: </h2>
        <li> definition demands the loneliness of the frontier. the last element cannot have two neighbors. </li>
        <li> documentation of those before you can be a great ailment to treat an absence of observable reflection. </li>
        <li> i simply have to become okay with the fact that i am not normal, and in fact nobody is, as previously explored. i need to continuously re-internalize this so that it doesn't shake me later when feedback reasserts the signal. </li>
        <li> the harmonies of madness and greatness have long helped provide a stable reference point for the concept of symphony. </li>
        <li> as long as i get up and walk every single day, i have to end up somewhere. </li>
    <h2> i don't think you have to lose your mind to succeed</h2>
    <p> if success is your goal, that's fine. it's human and earthly and great, especially in a mortal sense.</p> 
    <p> however, it is likely that minting greatness requires an orthogonal exchange. one prioritizing inputs more than outputs. </p>
    <p> greatness appears a byproduct of divine pursuit, at least in its most observably representative cases. </p>
    <h2> leBron has been in the league for 22 years.</h2> 
    <p> if success was the goal he would have retired. if greatness was the goal we would have retired. he is simply in pursuit - and it has nothing to do with man, or even himself. </p>
    <h2>  i'm on the road and i'm marching. i've lost my mind a bit in the name of pursuit and i'm marching. a divine storm is brewing and it is all happening and i am waking up daily to terraform. and i'm marching. godspeed. </h2>
